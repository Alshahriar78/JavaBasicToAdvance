## About the Project

**JavaBasicToAdvance** is a curated collection of Java programs and examples designed to guide learners from fundamental topics (like variables, control flow, and OOP principles) to advanced techniques (such as collections, threads, file handling, and design patterns). Each module focuses on hands-on code and step-by-step explanations, ideal for self-study or classroom use.

---

## Features

- 📗 **Core Java Concepts**: Data types, operators, loops, conditionals  
- 🏷️ **OOP & Design Patterns**: Classes, inheritance, polymorphism, abstraction, encapsulation  
- 🛠️ **Advanced Topics**: Collections, exception handling, file I/O, multi-threading  
- 💡 **Practice Examples**: Real-world scenarios to strengthen understanding  
- 🧪 **Modular Code**: Each concept organized in discrete packages  
- ✅ **Ready-to-Run**: Easily adaptable in any Java IDE (e.g., IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse, VS Code)

---

## Prerequisites

Before diving in, ensure you have:

- **Java JDK 11 or newer** installed — verify via `java -version`  
- A Java-compatible **IDE** or build tool (e.g., IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse, VS Code, Maven, or Gradle)

---

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository**  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Alshahriar78/JavaBasicToAdvance.git
   cd JavaBasicToAdvance
   ```
2. **Open it** in your preferred IDE.  
3. **If using Maven/Gradle**: import the project so external dependencies (if any) are resolved.

---

## Usage

1. Navigate to a package in the `com.bazlur.java` directory (e.g., `com.bazlur.java.oop`).  
2. Select and run the main class within that package (e.g., `Main.java`).  
3. Modify or extend example classes to experiment with variations.  
4. Observe console output and debug if necessary—learning is hands-on!
